Response 
Request URL: http://localhost:8080/HTTPProtocoluge2/
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 304 

GET /HTTPProtocoluge2/ HTTP/1.1

Explain what you see:
Her ser vi request og response, i dette tilfælde får man status code 304 som er en redirection. 

EX2
HTTP keep-alive, a.k.a., HTTP persistent connection, 
is an instruction that allows a single TCP connection to remain open for multiple HTTP 
requests/responses.

By default, HTTP connections close after each request. 
When someone visits your site, their browser needs to create new connections to request
each of the files that make up your web pages 
(e.g. images, Javascript, and CSS stylesheets), a process that can lead to high page load times.

Dvs: Man opretter færre forbindelser, og derved øges effektiviteten i form af hastighed og ydelse. 

ex2:
The two HTTP-request you see: 
Redicret:  
Request URL: http://localhost:8080/HTTPProtocoluge2/redirect
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 302 

r.html: 
Request URL: http://localhost:8080/HTTPProtocoluge2/redirect
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 302

How the browser knew where to go in the second request:
Gennem Http gives adgang til redicrets metoden"doGet" i dette tilfælde har vi 
placeret et fast response "response.sendRedirect("r.html")" som altid vil føre til 
uml: http://localhost:8080/HTTPProtocoluge2/r.html

exc: 3a.

Explain the first two request monitored (notice where you requested to go, and where you actually ended).

4c) Status Codes - Ranges
200 OK The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:
302 Found :This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. 
           New changes in the URI might be made in the future.
           Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.

403 Forbidden
           The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they are unauthorized,
           so server is rejecting to give proper response.
           Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server.
404 Not Found
           The server can not find requested resource. In the browser,
           this means the URL is not recognized. 
           In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid 
           but the resource itself does not exist.
           Servers may also send this response instead of 403
           to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. 
           This response code is probably the most famous one due to its
           frequent occurrence on the web.
